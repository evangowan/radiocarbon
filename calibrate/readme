Steps:

- create a tab separated value with the radiocarbon dates in radocarbon_list.txt. An example of the format is given here. Some notes (also in generate_priors.sh):

# Sample Code, latitude, longitude, age (yr BP), error (1 sigma), correction type, correction amount, correction error, calibration curve, material dated, reference

# for correction type, use:
# 0 - no correction
# 1 - marine
# 2 - terrestrial correction

- run generate_priors.sh to run OxCal and generate the calibrated probability distribution functions (priors)
- run age_ranges.sh to create a file with statistics of the priors, which is put in the file "age_parameters"
