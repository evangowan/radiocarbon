General warnings about radiocarbon dates
--------------------------------------------

Using a terrestrial freshwater correction might be a bit tenuous. If you look at Grimm et al. (2009), the range of error for bulk freshwater
samples and contemporaneous terrestrial macrofossils in freshwater basins located in previously glaciated regions in the midwestern
United States ranges between 0 and 8000 years, with variations between 500 and 2000 years common. MacDonald et al. (1991) did a similar
study in the foothills of Alberta, and found a discrepency that was as large as 5000 years.

Peat is also problematic when it comes to radiocarbon dating. Brock et al. (2010) investigated the age of a tephra layer in
a periglacial environment in the Yukon and found the variability of ages in different fractions of the peat lead to variability
on the order of 2000-3000 radiocarbon years (though all of the radiocarbon are over 25,000 yr BP). Another example by Brock et al (2011)
in a previously glaciated region of Germany. The age of Holocene peat using different acid fractions and crystal sizes from the same horizons
gave a varibility of 1000-1500 radiocarbon years. The age discrepancy between the true age of the peat and the bulk date may
not be as great as with freshwater samples, but could still make the full map older than it actually should be.

Though not a bulk sediment, charcoal may also be a problematic material. A good illustration of this is in Hebda et al (2008),
who noted that there was a lot of redeposited charcoal in a region of northeastern British Columbia. The charcoal was derived
from nearby sediments, and gave ages that were significantly older than that of deposition. Fossil bones have also been known to be
redeposited in postglacial sediment (i.e. Hebda et al. 2008 and Hills and Wilson, 2003), though it is likely less ambiguous whether
they represent pre or post glacial origin.

Note that I imagine that Dyke et al (2003) only picked samples where such contamination problems did not affect the date in an obvious
way. Chances are, the amount of contamination is low. Nevertheless, it is prudent to be cautious with such samples, as most
were done by old counter methods, and likely required a substantial volume to produce a date. Most samples reported during the
past 10 years have been dates on macrofossils using AMS methods, and should be held to a higher confidence.

Marine mammals are problematic because although their diet is mostly organisms from the ocean, they do not stay put
in the same location. I have been using the suggested corrections by Furze et al (2014) for reservoir
correction.
