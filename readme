Evan Gowan's tools relating manipulating and using radiocarbon dates.


In this top directory, make sure to extract OxCal (download OxCalDistribution.zip from here: https://c14.arch.ox.ac.uk/oxcal.html).
It will produce a folder called "OxCal". The scripts in these folders depend on OxCal being there!

----------------------------------

So far there are the following tools:

**************
* reservoir
**************

This includes scripts to extract the delta-R value from Martin Butzin et al (2017) modelled marine reservoir corrections.

**************
* calibrate
**************

Tools to calibrate radiocarbon dates with OxCal, and output statistics of the calibrated date into a file.


**************
* sea_level
**************

Tools to plot and assess relative sea level data, including glacio-isostatic adjustment.


-----------------------------------


Many of these tools were developed during my PHD. If you use them, I ask you to cite the following paper:

Gowan, E.J., Tregoning, P., Purcell, A., Montillet, J.P. and McClusky, S., 2016. 
	A model of the western Laurentide Ice Sheet, using observations of glacial 
	isostatic adjustment. Quaternary Science Reviews, 139, pp.1-16.
